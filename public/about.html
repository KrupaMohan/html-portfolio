<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am Krupa Mohan, a dedicated and results-driven Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) student at REVA University,
  Bengaluru, currently in my third year of BTech. With a strong academic foundation and a CGPA of 8.66, I have developed
  expertise in a wide range of programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, and C++, as well as web development 
  frameworks such as ReactJS and NodeJS. I am committed to continuously learning and growing in the ever-evolving field 
  of technology.

  I recently completed a web development internship at Skillcraft Technology, where I worked on various projects, 
  including responsive landing pages, interactive stopwatches, and full-stack applications like a task management app. 
  This hands-on experience helped me sharpen my skills in both front-end and back-end development, as well as in creating 
  dynamic, user-friendly web applications. I also developed a weather prediction system using Machine Learning and Big Data, 
  demonstrating my ability to handle complex datasets and predictive models.

  Beyond my technical skills, I enjoy video editing, social media management, and fashion. Fluent in English, Kannada, Hindi, 
  and Tamil, I communicate effectively in diverse environments. Iâ€™m always looking for new challenges and opportunities to expand 
  my knowledge and contribute to innovative projects. I'm excited about the future and the potential to make an impact in the tech 
  industry.
